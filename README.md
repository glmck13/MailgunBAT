Windows batch script for Mailgun

The attached Windows batch script sends email through Mailgun making use of the following components:
* [Mailgun API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api_reference.html)
* [Mailgun templates](https://www.mailgun.com/blog/product/mailgun-template-builder)
* [Mailgun mailing lists](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#mailing-lists-1)
* Windows curl

To get started, follow the Mailgun instructions posted [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-sending.html).  The most important step is to get your domain name properly configured so that Mailgun can use it to send email.  Afterwards youâ€™ll want to create an email distribution list together with a template that contains the body of your email.  The template can contain substitution variables that are enclosed in double braces, i.e. {{ this_is_a_variable }}.  These user-defined variables can either be fixed strings or reference a second set of system-defined variables that depend upon the particular email recipient.  These system-defined variables are enclosed in percent signs, i.e. %recipient%.  You can find a list of them [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#mailing-lists-1).   Two brace-enclosed variables are defined in the attached batch script:
```
{{unsubscribe}} -> %mailing_list_unsubscribe_url%
{{name}} -> %recipient_name%
```
You can modify the script to define others as needed.
